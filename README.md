# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains projects and code implementations from the "Data Structures and Algorithms" course. The course covered a wide range of essential topics in data structures and algorithms. Here are the key highlights:

1. **Fundamental Data Structures:**
   - Proficiently utilized fundamental data structures such as stacks, queues, and linked lists.
   - Demonstrated the ability to implement and apply these data structures efficiently.

2. **Tree Structures:**
   - Showcased expertise in working with tree structures, including heaps and various tree types.
   - Implemented and utilized Binary Search Trees (BST), Huffman trees, and Red-Black trees for efficient data organization and retrieval.

3. **Graph Algorithms:**
   - Applied graph traversal algorithms, including Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).
   - Utilized these algorithms to find optimal paths and solutions in complex graphs.

These projects and assignments provided hands-on experience in data structures and algorithm design, which are fundamental skills in computer science and software development.

Feel free to explore the individual project folders within this repository for more details and code implementations.
